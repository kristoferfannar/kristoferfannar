Hi. I'm Krist√≥fer, a Software Engineering student.

I graduated with a B.Sc in Software Engineering from Reykjavik University in 2024, with an exchange semester at the University of Copenhagen during spring 2023.
I'm set to start my graduate studies in Computer Science this fall at Columbia University.

Here are some debatably informative stats:

### Projects

I have a number of projects I'm particularly proud of. 
Some are private, either because they are owned by companies I worked for or are a solution to an assignment in courses.

However, of those that are publicly avaiable, my favourite are listed below:


#### [Desktop Defender](https://github.com/desktopdefender/desktopdefender) | *March 2024 - current*

A desktop application for users to get a simple and straightforward intuition and overview of their home network.

#### [PremKing](https://github.com/kristo-og-logi/premking) | *June 2023 - current*

A mobile application for friends to create leagues and compete for who is the best fixture guesser for the Premier League.

#### [EHR_PROTOTYPE](https://github.com/Kadayak/EHR_PROTOTYPE) | *Feb 2023 - June 2023*

Web application for electronic health records. Group project
