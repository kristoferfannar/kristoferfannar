Hi. I'm Krist√≥fer, a Computer Science student.

I've been coding since 2020 --- with a B.Sc in Software Engineering from Reykjavik University and 
  currently enrolled in a M.Sc at Columbia University, studying Computer Science with emphasis on 
  Software Systems and Cybersecurity.

You'll find most my code here but not a lot of context. 
For some of that, refer to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristoferfannar/) or [my website](https://kristoferfannar.github.io) (WIP).
